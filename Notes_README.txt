			             Starting Notes


	The master branch contains the code I got from the class website. Clone/pull the master branch to your computer to work on it. Create a local branch in your local repository (titled with your name) that contains the code you're working on (i.e our assigned scheduling algorithms). 

	Once each of us are done with our part and is sure that it works %100 we can merge each of our branches to the master branch. From there we can work on the RR scheduling and anything else.

*** For Macs using Github***

In Github, after switching to the project repository;
	- Go to the "Branches" tab
	- Make a branch off the "master" branch titled with your name
	- Work with that branch and once synched, it will show up on the online repo as an 		unmerged branch on Master
	- Leave that and we'll work on our branches until done. We will merge on Monday.
