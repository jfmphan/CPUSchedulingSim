			    Starting Notes


	The master branch contains the code I got from the class website. Clone/pull the master branch to your computer to work on it. If the branches are not already up, try to make your own branches (titled with your name) that contains the code you're working on (i.e our assigned scheduling algorithms). 

	Once each of us are done with our part and is sure that it works %100 we can merge each of our branches to the master branch. From there we can work on the RR scheduling and anything else.
